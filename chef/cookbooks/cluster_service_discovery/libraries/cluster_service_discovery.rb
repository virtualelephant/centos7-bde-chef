# ClusterServiceDiscovery --
#
# Allow nodes to discover the location for a given service at runtime, adapting
# when new services register.
#
# Operations:
#
# * provide a service. A timestamp records the last registry.
# * discover all providers for the given service.
# * discover the most recent provider for that service.
# * get the 'public_ip' for a provider -- the address that nodes in the larger
#   world should use
# * get the 'public_ip' for a provider -- the address that nodes on the local
#   subnet / private cloud should use
#
# Implementation
#
# Nodes register a service by setting the +[:provides_service][service_name]+
# attribute. This attribute is a hash containing at 'timestamp' (the time of
# registry), but the service can pass in an arbitrary hash of values to merge
# in.
